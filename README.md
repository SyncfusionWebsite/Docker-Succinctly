Dockerfiles for the custom images used in the book are stored here. Images built from the files using 'sixeyed/' tags in the book are on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sixeyed/). For Linux/x64 images they are automated builds. For Windows and ARM images, they have been manually built and pushed from these files.
